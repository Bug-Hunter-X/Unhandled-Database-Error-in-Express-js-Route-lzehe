# Unhandled Database Error in Express.js Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling during database interactions.  The `bug.js` file shows an example of a route that crashes silently if a database query fails. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling.

## Problem

The original code lacks proper error handling.  If the database query (`db.getUser`) fails, the application will likely crash or throw an uncaught exception, providing no useful feedback to the user.

## Solution

The solution implements comprehensive error handling. The code explicitly checks for errors returned by the database query and sends appropriate HTTP error responses with informative messages.  This prevents crashes and gives the user a better experience.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the `bug.js` file. Simulate a database error (e.g., by making the `db.getUser` function always fail).
4. Observe the lack of error handling.
5. Repeat for `bugSolution.js` and see the improved behavior.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in production-level applications. Always handle potential errors, providing meaningful feedback to users and preventing unexpected application crashes.
